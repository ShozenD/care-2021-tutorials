### Installing and Loading Packages

```{r}
# install.packages("tidyverse")
# install.packages("car")

library(tidyverse)
```

```{r message = F, warning = F}
df.nhis <- read_csv("samadult_2017.csv")
head(df.nhis)
```

## Data Types Overview
*   Vectors are one dimensionsal objects of length n, all one data type
*   Lists are an ordered lists of miscellaneous objects
*   Dataframes are rectangular arrays (rows and columns) of **mixed** data types (each column can be a different data type)

## Vectors - all of same data type

```{r}
# To define a vector, you should just use vector <- c() and separate elements with a ,
a <- c("red", "blue")    # strings put into object b
b <- c(1,2,5,16,832)     # numbers put into object b
b[3]         # return the third element in this vector
b[c(1,3,5)]  # return the first, third, fifth elements
b[c(1:3)]    #return the first through third elements

# Exercise - for the vector below, rename the third element to "red" and print out the 4th element
test <- c("blue", "yellow", "green", "purple")
# Insert code here
```

## Lists - can be different data types

```{r}
x <- list("Red",45,c(1,2,5)) # put different variable types into list x
x[1]               #return first item from list
x[3]               #return third item from list as a list
x[[3]]             #return third item from list not as a list

class(x[3])               
class(x[[3]]) 

x.new <- xvec[[3]]     #put third item into a new object
```

## Tables - tables are a convenient way to organize data of a certain data type

```{r}
## Numerical Table - one way
table(df.nhis$SEX)

## Numerical Table - two way
table(df.nhis$MRACBPI2, df.nhis$SEX) #MRACBPI2 = race
```

```{r}
## Proportion Table! 
y <- table(df.nhis$MRACBPI2, df.nhis$SEX)

# The margin parameter represents whether you want to determine the proportions by row (1) or by column ()
prop.table(y, margin = 1) 
prop.table(y, margin = 2) 

# Exercise - create a proportion table between the variables MRACBPI2 and AGE_P, with proportions determined by column
# Insert code here
```

## Dataframe! - this will be the datatype that you use the most. It is the easiest way to deal with large data in R. Each column can be its own data type. Most functions require dataframes as inputs. 

```{r}
# df.nhis <- read_csv("samadult_2017.csv")
# Dataframes can be imported in R as done above 

# Or we can convert tables into dataframes
y.df <- as.data.frame(y)
```

### Working with Data Frames (Brief introduction to Tidyverse)

-   As a data scientist you will be spending 70 \~ 90 % of the time
    pre-processing data (i.e. cleaning, re-coding, re-formatting).
-   Using indexing and other traditional ways of formatting data works
    BUT the code can get really long and complex, which increases the
    chances of error.
-   R is a old language (28 years old!), so most of the new innovation
    occurs in the shape of software packages. There is a coherent system
    of packages for data manipulation, exploration, and visualization
    called `tidyverse` that will make your life much easier.
-   We will be covering `dplyr` and `ggplot2` (both are part of the
    `tidyverse` ecosystem) in this tutorial.

\`dplyr\` aims to provide a function for each basic verb of data
manipulation. I will introduce the 3 most heavily used "verbs" but if
you want to know what else is available, check out this [cheet
sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/data-wrangling-cheatsheet.pdf).

#### Renaming Columns

One of the first things you'll notice about NHIS is that some columns
have really obscure column names. For example, the column that contains
the race/ethnicity info is called \`MRACBPI2\` (Don't ask me why...).
So, one the first things you'll probably want to do is change the name!

```{r}
### Make a copy of the NHIS data frame ###
df.nhis.copy <- df.nhis

### Traditional way of doing it (not recommended) ###

nhis.colnames <- names(df.nhis.copy) # A vector of column names in the dataframe
which(nhis.colnames == "MRACBPI2") # Figure out the column number of MRACBPI2
nhis.colnames[12] <- "race" # Change "MRACBPI2" to "race"
names(df.nhis.copy) <- nhis.colnames # Rename the column in the dataframe

df.nhis.copy$race # Check

# names(df.nhis.copy)[names(df.nhis.copy) == "MRACBPI2"] <- "race" # A one liner

### The dplyr way of doing it ###
df.nhis <- dplyr::rename(df.nhis, race = MRACBPI2) # There may be other functions named rename
                                                   # thus I'm specifying that I want dplyr's
                                                   # rename function using dplyr::
df.nhis$race # Check

# I can also rename multiple columns
df.nhis <- dplyr::rename(df.nhis,
                         age = AGE_P,
                         sex = SEX,
                         smoke = SMKSTAT2,
                         alcohol = ALCSTAT)

# I can also do this (More advanced but may come in handy)
old.names <- c("STREV", "CANEV", "EPHEV", "DIBEV1", "HYPEV")           # The index of names
new.names <- c("stroke", "cancer", "lung", "diabetes", "hypertension") # must match

df.nhis <- rename_at(df.nhis, vars(old.names), ~new.names)

# To see the manual for "rename" you can type
?rename
```

#### Selecting Columns

Another thing you may be thinking now is that 702 columns is too much! I
don't need all the variables, I only need the ones that I am interested
in! To select columns, simply use the \`select\` verb.

```{r}
### Traditional way ###
# select a single column
df.nhis[,"age"]

# select multiple columns
df.nhis[,c("age", "sex", "race", "stroke", "cancer")]

### dyplr way ###
# select a single column
select(df.nhis, age)

# select multiple columns
select(df.nhis, age, sex)

# EXERCISE: Select the columns for age, sex, race, stroke, diabetes, and hypertension
#           and save it in a dataframe called df.nhis.2 

# df.nhis.2 <- (Uncomment and enter your code here)
  
# Again, you can read the documentation for "select" by doing:
?select
```

#### Creating New Columns and Re-coding Variables

Let's take a look at the sex column for a second.

```{r}
df.nhis.2$sex # Extract a column as a vector
```

It seems like the sex variable is a bunch of 1s and 2s. From the code
book we know that 1 means male and 2 means female, but this is anyone
without a code book won't know this and it is easy to forget. We want to
re-code this variable such that instead of 1s and 2s, we have "males"
and "females". We can do this by creating a new column using the
`mutate` verb in combination with `ifelse`. I will also introduce a
really convenient function \`%\>%\` called a pipe function.

```{r}
df.nhis.2 %>% 
  mutate(
    r_sex = ifelse(sex == 1, "male", "female"),
  )

# Without %>%
df.nhis.2 <- mutate(df.nhis.2, 
                    r_sex = ifelse(sex == 1, "male", "female"))
```

The pipe function passes the data frame to the mutate function, which
means we don't have to type `mutate(df.nhis.2, ...)`. I will demonstrate
later how using the pipe function will make your code much more shorter
and readable.

Here, we use `mutate` to create a new column named `r_sex` (short for
re-coded sex) where if the value of the `sex` column was "1", then
`r_sex` would be coded as "male". Else, `r_sex` would be coded as
"female".

```{r}
# EXERCISE: Create a new column named r_diabetes, that recodes the diabetes column
#           Hint: 1 -> "yes", 2 -> "no", 3 ~> Ignore for now!

# df.nhis.2 <- (Uncomment and enter your code here!)
```

Now that we have re-coded `sex` and `diabetes` let's try and re-code
`race`. The `ifelse` verb worked well on the previous two variables
because they are binary, but `race` has multiple categories (well
duh...) so we need something else. Fortunately, there is a generalized
if-else verb called `case_when`.

```{r}
# Using mutate and case_when to recode race
df.nhis.2 <- df.nhis.2 %>%
  mutate(
    r_race = case_when(
      race == 1 ~ "nhw",
      race == 6 ~ "chinese",
      race == 7 ~ "filipino",
      race == 12 ~ "asian indian",
      TRUE ~ "other" # Handles all other cases!
    )
    r_race = factor(r_race, levels = c("nhw", "chinese", "filipino", "asian indian"))
  )

# While we're at it let's also stratify the age variable
df.nhis.2 <- df.nhis.2 %>%
  mutate(
    r_age = case_when(
      age < 26 ~ "18~25",
      age < 45 ~ "26~44",
      age < 65 ~ "45~64",
      age >= 65 ~ "+65"
    ),
    r_age = factor(age, levels = c("18~25","26~44","45~64","+65"))
  )

# A fancy way of doing it for advanced users
df.nhis.2 %>%
  mutate(
    r_race = plyr::mapvalues(race,
                             from = c(1,6,7,12),
                             to = c("nhw", "chinese", "filipino", "asian indian"))
  )

# EXERCISE: Using mutate and case_when, recode the diabetes column again but this time:
#           1 -> "yes", 2 -> "no", 3 -> "prediabetes"
```

#### Filtering rows

Sometimes (a lot of times really), you want to limit your sample to
respondents with a certain characteristic. For example, this program
focuses on Asian American subgroups so we might want to filter out the
other race groups from our sample (Not that they are not important!).
For this, we can use the `filter` verb.

```{r}
# Filter the data for nhw, and AA subgroups
df.nhis.2 %>% 
  filter(r_race %in% c("nhw", "chinese", "filipino", "asian indian")) # %in% = if included in

# Use can also do
df.nhis.2 %>%
  filter(r_race != "other") # != means "not equal to"

# EXERCISE: Filter out those responents who have prediabetes
# df.nhis.2 %>% filter(...Your code here...)
```

## Dataframe Summaries

To get the size/dimension/length of objects use

*  `dim()` for matrices and dataframes
*  `length()` for vectors and lists

To find out the type of an object use 

*  `str()`  - this gives the structure of an object

```{r}
# See the first 5 rows of a dataframe
head(df.nhis.2)

# See the last 5 rows of a dataframe
tail(df.nhis.2)

# See all the columns of the dataframe
names(df.nhis.2)

# See the data types of all the variables
str(df.nhis.2)

#If you have a column that is numeric and want the 5 number summary
summary(df.nhis.2$AGE_P)
```

## Appendix

```{r}
#Boxplot of just the variable
boxplot(sleepCleaned$ASISLEEP, col = "blue")

#Boxplot of variable by race
boxplot(sleepCleaned$ASISLEEP ~ sleepCleaned$raceRecoded, col = c("blue", "red", "pink", "green"))
```

```{r}
sleepAndNervCleaned <- sleepCleaned[!(sleepCleaned$ASINERV == 7 | sleepCleaned$ASINERV == 8 | sleepCleaned$ASINERV == 9), ]

#Take a quick look at the relationship between the two, what is the issue with this?
plot(sleepAndNervCleaned$ASISLEEP ~ sleepAndNervCleaned$ASINERV, pch = 19, col = "blue")

plot(jitter(sleepAndNervCleaned$ASISLEEP) ~ jitter(sleepAndNervCleaned$ASINERV), pch = 19, col = "blue")

#Get the correlation
(cor <- cor(sleepAndNervCleaned$ASISLEEP, sleepAndNervCleaned$ASINERV))

#Actually do a Correlation Test 
cor.test(sleepAndNervCleaned$ASISLEEP, sleepAndNervCleaned$ASINERV)

#Linear Regression Model 
lm1 <-  lm(sleepAndNervCleaned$ASISLEEP ~ sleepAndNervCleaned$ASINERV)
summary(lm1)

plot(jitter(sleepAndNervCleaned$ASISLEEP) ~ jitter(sleepAndNervCleaned$ASINERV), pch = 19, col = "red", ylab = "Hours of Sleep", xlab = "Scale of Nervousness (1 = All the time, 5 = None of the time)")
abline(lm1$coef, col = "blue", lwd = 3)
```

Basic T Test

```{r}
sleepAndNervCleaned$sexRecoded <- Recode(sleepAndNervCleaned$SEX, '"1" = "Male"; "2" = "Female"')

t.test(sleepAndNervCleaned$ASISLEEP ~ sleepAndNervCleaned$sexRecoded) 
```

Tables and Frequencies

```{r}
asinerv <- onlyAsianAndWhite[!(is.na(onlyAsianAndWhite$ASINERV)), ]
asinerv <- asinerv[!(asinerv$ASINERV == 7 | asinerv$ASINERV == 8 | asinerv$ASINERV == 9), ]

asinerv_table <- table(asinerv$ASINERV) #raw counts by themselves

asinervbyrace <- table(asinerv$ASINERV, asinerv$raceRecoded) #raw counts by race

racecounts <- colSums(asinervbyrace) 

asinervbyrace_pct <- asinervbyrace
for (i in 1:length(colnames(asinervbyrace))){
  asinervbyrace_pct[ ,i] <- (asinervbyrace[ ,i]/ (racecounts[i])) * 100
}

#Table of Frequencies
asinervbyrace_pct

#Plot!
ggplot(data.frame(asinervbyrace_pct), aes(fill=Var1, y=Freq, x=Var2)) + 
    geom_bar(position="fill", stat="identity") + ggtitle("ASINERV") + annotate("text", x = 1:4, y = .05, label = racecounts)
```
